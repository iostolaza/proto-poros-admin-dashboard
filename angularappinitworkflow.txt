Written Explanation: Execution Flow and File Communication
When you run your Angular app (via ng serve for development or ng build for production), Angular follows a structured bootstrap and rendering process. It's not a linear "script execution" like Node.js; instead, it's a component-based architecture where the browser loads the bundled JavaScript, and Angular's runtime (via Zone.js and change detection) handles rendering and updates. Communication happens through imports/exports (for sharing classes/functions), dependency injection (for services), routing (for lazy-loading pages), and template bindings (for component composition). Here's the step-by-step flow:

Entry Point: main.ts (First File Executed)
This is the application's bootstrap file. When the browser loads index.html (which includes script tags for the bundled JS/CSS from your build), it executes main.ts first.
What it does: Imports the root component (App from app.ts) and calls bootstrapApplication(App, config), where config comes from app.config.ts. This initializes the Angular runtime, sets up providers (e.g., router), and renders the root component.
Communication: Exports nothing directly; it pulls in App via import and configs via app.config.ts. If you add global providers (e.g., a service), you'd update app.config.ts.
Why first? It's specified in angular.json as the main entry file.
Configuration: app.config.ts
Executed during bootstrap (via main.ts). Provides app-wide settings like routing.
What it does: Exports a config object with providers, such as provideRouter(routes) where routes is imported from app.routes.ts.
Communication: Imports routes from app.routes.ts and uses dependency injection to make the router available app-wide. If you add features like HTTP interceptors, you'd add them here (e.g., provideHttpClient()).
Routing: app.routes.ts
Loaded when the router is initialized (during bootstrap). Defines navigation paths.
What it does: Exports an array of Routes, importing components like Dashboard from dashboard.ts. For your app, it redirects '' to '/dashboard' and loads Dashboard for that path.
Communication: Exports routes for use in app.config.ts. Components are imported here for route definitions. To add features, import new components (e.g., import { Users } from './users/users';) and add routes like { path: 'users', component: Users }. For lazy loading (best practice for scalability), change to { path: 'users', loadComponent: () => import('./users/users').then(m => m.Users) }—this bundles the feature separately, improving load times.
Root Component: app.ts (and its template app.html)
Instantiated after bootstrap. This is the top-level component that composes the UI.
What it does: Defines the App class with imports for child components (e.g., Header, Sidebar) and modules (e.g., MatToolbarModule). It uses OnPush change detection for performance (only re-renders on input/signal changes).
Communication:
Imports: Pulls in child components (e.g., import { Header } from './header/header';) and declares them in the imports array so they can be used in app.html.
Template Binding: app.html uses tags like <app-header> (which resolves to Header via its selector) and <router-outlet> (from Angular's router, which loads routed components like Dashboard).
Exports: The App class is exported for bootstrap in main.ts. No direct exports for other files—communication is one-way via composition.
State: If you add signals (e.g., const isSidebarOpen = signal(true);), child components can receive them via inputs (e.g., const sidebarOpen = input<boolean>(); in sidebar.ts).
Child Components: header/, sidebar/, dashboard/ (and their files)
Loaded on-demand: Header and Sidebar are eagerly loaded (imported in app.ts), while Dashboard is loaded via routing.
What each file does:
*.ts: The component class (e.g., export class Header {}), with imports, signals, and logic. Exports the class for parent imports.
*.html: Template (rendered when the component is used).
*.css: Scoped styles (applied only to this component).
*.spec.ts: Unit tests (not executed at runtime; run via ng test).
Communication:
Parent-Child: Parents import and use child selectors in templates (e.g., <app-sidebar> in app.html). Pass data via inputs (e.g., const title = input<string>(); in child, bound as <app-child [title]="parentSignal()" />). Emit events via outputs (e.g., const onClick = output<void>();).
Siblings/Routes: Via shared services (e.g., create auth.service.ts with providedIn: 'root', inject with inject(AuthService), use signals for reactive state). Or router params/queries.
Exports/Imports: Each *.ts exports its class (e.g., export class Sidebar {}) for imports elsewhere. No circular imports—keep hierarchy top-down.
Global Files and Build Process
index.html: Loaded first by the browser; includes <app-root> (selector from app.ts) and script tags for bundles.
styles.css / custom-theme.scss: Global styles (imported in angular.json).
Build Flow: ng serve compiles TS to JS, bundles (using esbuild), watches for changes, and serves at localhost:4200. Runtime uses change detection to update the DOM based on signals/inputs.
Adding Features: Create new folders under src/app/ (e.g., ng generate component users adds users/users.ts etc.). Import in parents/routes, export classes, and use in templates. For services: ng generate service auth (adds auth.service.ts), use inject().
Overall, the flow is bootstrap → config/router → root component → compose children via imports/templates → route/load features. It's reactive: Changes (e.g., signal updates) trigger efficient re-renders with OnPush. This scales well—add components/services as needed without bloating the root.

The standard is importer --> imported.

Step 1: Generate the Maps Component
Step 2: Update Routing (src/app/app.routes.ts)
Step 3: Update Sidebar Template (src/app/sidebar/sidebar.html)
Step 4: Update Maps Component Logic (src/app/maps/maps.ts)
Step 5: Update Maps Template (src/app/maps/maps.html)
Step 6: Update Maps Styles (src/app/maps/maps.css)
Final Testing

Run ng serve to rebuild and serve the app.
Navigate to http://localhost:4200, 
click "Maps" in the sidebar—it should lazy-load 
and display the map in the main section.

Adding a "Maps" Feature: Example Scripts to Edit/Add

Generate the Maps Component (Adds new files under src/app/maps/):

ng generate component maps

This creates:
src/app/maps/maps.ts
src/app/maps/maps.html
src/app/maps/maps.css
src/app/maps/maps.spec.ts

Edit Existing Scripts:
Update src/app/app.routes.ts (Add lazy-loaded route for /maps);

cat << EOF > src/app/app.routes.ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { Dashboard } from './dashboard/dashboard';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/dashboard', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'dashboard', component: Dashboard },
  { path: 'maps', loadComponent: () => import('./maps/maps').then(m => m.Maps) } // Lazy-load for scalability
];
EOF

Update src/app/sidebar/sidebar.html (Add a link to /maps):

cat << EOF > src/app/sidebar/sidebar.html
<p>Navigation Links</p>
<a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
<a routerLink="/maps">Maps</a>
EOF

No changes to sidebar.ts needed (RouterLink is already imported).


Add/Edit New Scripts for Maps:

cat << EOF > src/app/maps/maps.ts
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import * as L from 'leaflet'; // Assume Leaflet installed

@Component({
  selector: 'app-maps',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './maps.html',
  styleUrl: './maps.css',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class Maps {
  // Example signal for local state (e.g., map zoom level)
  zoomLevel = signal(10);

  // Derived computed state
  mapDescription = computed(() => \`Current zoom: \${this.zoomLevel()}\`);

  ngOnInit() {
    // Initialize map (example; in real app, use AfterViewInit and ViewChild for DOM ref)
    const map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], this.zoomLevel());
    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);
  }
}
EOF

Update src/app/maps/maps.html (Simple template):

cat << EOF > src/app/maps/maps.html
<h1>Maps Feature</h1>
<div id="map" style="height: 400px;"></div>
<p>{{ mapDescription() }}</p>
<button (click)="zoomLevel.set(zoomLevel() + 1)">Zoom In</button>
EOF

Update src/app/maps/maps.css (Basic styles):

cat << EOF > src/app/maps/maps.css
#map { width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc; }
EOF
